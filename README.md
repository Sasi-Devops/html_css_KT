hi hello 


Yup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. Define a schema, transform a value to match, validate the shape of an existing value, or both. Yup schema are extremely expressive and allow modeling complex, interdependent validations, or value transformations.

Yup's API is heavily inspired by Joi, but leaner and built with client-side validation as its primary use-case. Yup separates the parsing and validating functions into separate steps. cast() transforms data while validate checks tha

Install
npm install -S yup
Yup always relies on the Promise global object to handle asynchronous values as well as Set and Map. For browsers that do not support these, you'll need to include a polyfill, such as core-js:t the input is the correct shape. Each can be performed together (such as HTML form validation) or seperately (such as deserializing trusted data from APIs).
